# Closes the "nothing wired" monitoring gap in docs/DEPLOYMENT.md §7 -
# CloudWatch alarms for the signals that matter most (service health, DB
# pressure, cache memory), all publishing to one SNS topic. Extend with a
# PagerDuty/Slack/Opsgenie subscription on the same topic before relying
# on this for real on-call paging - email alone is a reasonable starting
# point, not a final on-call solution.
